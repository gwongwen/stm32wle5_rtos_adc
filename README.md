# Code for 6sens Omnitilt Project : test of STM32 ADC

## Overview
This first code allow us to convert a voltage and add processing to it :

 - send the numerical value to LoraWAN if it excedds a threshold. 
 - store this value to the internal non volative memory if it does not excedd this threshold

The analog value is generated by a voltage divider bridge of a 3.7V Li-Po battery.
This code is simple and is just a test: the ADC is on polling mode and there is no interrupt program to implement.
